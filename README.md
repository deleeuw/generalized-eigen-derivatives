# generalized-eigen-derivatives

The derivatives of eigenvalues and eigenvectors (and singular values and vectors)
are used in many places in multivariate data analysis. This paper reviews a number of
formulas for these derivatives and discusses several applications. R code implementing the   
basic formulas and applications is included. The results extend, generalize, correct, and   
improve the results of @deleeuw_R_07c.
